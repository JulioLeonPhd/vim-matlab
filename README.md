Matlab for vim
=============

### Where these codes come from?
These code doesn't own by me. I just copy it from [here](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/21798-editing-matlab-files-in-vim), and make it to be a git repo.

### Why this fork?
The reason I do this is because I think there are many people will want to use this plugin, and people may want to add some commit to this plugin, too. Therefore, host this plugin on github will make things more easier and happier.
